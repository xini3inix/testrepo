Hey there!

It's practically the same method as in Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel.

    Go to: \Documents\My Games\Borderlands Game of the Year\WillowGame\Config

    Open "WillowEngine.ini"

    Locate "DefaultPostProcessName=WillowEngineMaterials.WillowScenePostProcess"

    Change it to some of your favorite. (Remember to make a copy of your file).

This are the options:

1. Default:
DefaultPostProcessName=WillowEngineMaterials.WillowScenePostProcess

2. RyanScenePostProcess:
DefaultPostProcessName=WillowEngineMaterials.RyanScenePostProcess

3. ScenePostProcess:
DefaultPostProcessName=EngineMaterials.ScenePostProcess

4. CinematicScenePostProcess:
DefaultPostProcessName=WillowEngineMaterials.CinematicScenePostProcess

In your case, the best option is number 4.

Edit: If you can't find the DefaultPostProcessName line in your WillowEngine.ini file, try run the game and make some changes in video settings, this will force the 
game to save settings in your WillowEngine.ini file.

Cheers!
